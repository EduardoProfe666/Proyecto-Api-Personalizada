# Contributing to JLibGraph 😎

First of all, thank you for taking the time to contribute!! 😁

JLibGraph is a free software library, licensed under the terms of the GNU-LGPL v2.1, and as such, you are free to grab your own copy of the source code and develop 
your own super-duper graph theory library. However, if you are willing to contribute, we are open to it; but there are a few things you must have in account.

## House rules

* The project is strict Java, meaning that any substancial piece of code must be written in pure Java (no JNI dependences please). This ensures maximum portability
  across different architectures.
* One must conform to the code conventions stablished by us, the original contributors. The actual reason behind this, is that this is, at the time of writing, a university
  project designed to replace a library already in use, but must contain code that conform with everything taught at our uni.
